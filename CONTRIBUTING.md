# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing!
I am excited to build this game together.
This document outlines how you can contribute and what to expect.

## Our Vision and Future Plans

This project was started as a fun, open-source game. My goal is to build a fun and engaging game with the community.

- [Our Roadmap](https://github.com/YodasWs/Samnite-Supply-Lines/blob/master/ROADMAP.md)

**Please be aware that if the game becomes successful, there is a possibility that it may transition to a commercial, closed-source project.** This is to help fund its continued development and to compensate for the significant investment of time required to bring it to a high-quality finished state.

### Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

To ensure that I can legally transition the project for commercial purposes in the future, all contributors must agree to the terms of our Contributor License Agreement.

*   By submitting a pull request, you will be asked to confirm your agreement to the CLA.
*   The CLA grants me the necessary rights to use your contributions in a potential future commercial version of the game while you retain the copyright to your original work.
*   You can read the full text of the CLA [here](https://github.com/YodasWs/Samnite-Supply-Lines/blob/master/CLA.md).

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions of all kinds! Code and non-code controbutions are needed.

*   **Code:** If you're a developer, please check the [Issues](https://github.com/YodasWs/Samnite-Supply-Lines/issues) or [Kanban board](https://github.com/users/YodasWs/projects/3/) for areas where help is needed.
*   **Ideas and Feedback:** Share your thoughts on gameplay, features, and design in the [Discussions section](https://github.com/YodasWs/Samnite-Supply-Lines/discussions).
*   **Documentation:** Help us write and expand how-to guides over on our [wiki](https://github.com/YodasWs/Samnite-Supply-Lines/wiki).
*   **UX/UI Design and Art:** If you have design or artistic skills, we'd love your help creating a better user experience and graphics.
*   **Promote:** Please share the project on social media!

## Running on your computer

```bash
yarn
gulp
```
Then open http://localhost:3000/ in your browser.

## Found a bug?

Please feel free to open a new [Issue](https://github.com/YodasWs/Samnite-Supply-Lines/issues) to report any bugs. Please include as much detail as possible and how to recreate it.

## Have an idea to contribte?

If you have any feature requests or ideas for the game, please open a new Discussion so we can work to flesh out if it's appropriate for the game, how it could work, and how it might be implemented in the code.

## Open Issues

Please feel free to work on any Open Issue. You can get started by following the standard workflow:
1. **Comment** on the Issue to notify me and other potential contributers that you're working on the issue, to avoid unnecessary duplicate work.
2. **Fork** the repo to your account and clone to your computer.
3. **Run** the project on your computer, as documented above.
4. **Make changes** to the appropriate files. Currently all the game logic is in `src/pages/game/ctrl.js`.
  It's best to not include the updates made to the JavaScript, CSS, and HTML files in `docs/` in your commits to avoid unnecessary merge conflicts.
5. **Submit a Pull Request** in this project with your updates and be sure to mark it Ready for Review when you're done.

If you have any questions or get stuck at any point, just let me know in the comments on that Issue or in your Pull Request.

### Claiming and Assigning Issues.

To claim an issue, you may add a comment to the Issue saying you'd like to work on it. Once your Pull Request has been opened, I will assign the Issue to you. I'll likely start reviewing for code quality right away, but please be sure it's marked Ready for Review when you are finished so I can merge it and test it out.

Please be considerate not to block work for others if you're unable or unwilling to complete a task.
If I assign an Issue to you, but you don't open a Pull Request within a week, I'll assume you won't be completing the work and I'll free up the assignment for someone else to pick up. If you are still working on it but it's not ready for a Pull Request, please add a comment in the Issue to keep us updated.

If you start work on an Issue but get stuck on completing it or find you don't have time to finish it, please open a Draft Pull Request and let us know in a comment there on in the Issue and I or another contributor may be able to pick up where you left off.

## Documentation

This project has a [Wiki](https://github.com/YodasWs/Samnite-Supply-Lines/wiki). Please feel free to help expand the information there as we develop the game.

Documentation added on the parts of the game and how to play the game will be incorporated into the game itself as the Player's Help resources. You will be contributing just by sharing your knowledge and love of the game.

## Social Media

Please share links to the project and screenshots!

If you're a copywriter or social media manager, comtact me about how we can work together to publicize and promote the project and dev updates.

## What if the game becomes commercial?

If we decide to go commercial, we will clearly communicate our plans and timeline to the community. While we cannot guarantee payment for past contributions, we will explore ways to recognize and reward our early contributors who helped make the project a success.

We believe that being transparent from the start is the best way to build a trusting and collaborative community. Thanks for being part of this journey!
