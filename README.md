# Samnite Supply Lines — A Latent Hegemony™ Project

I'm building a tycoon game! You can [play now](https://yodasws.github.io/Samnite-Supply-Lines/#!/game/) in your browser.

### The empire is built not by legions, but by cart.

**Roman Logistics Tycoon** places you not in the sandals of a soldier or the robes of an emperor, but in the quiet power of Rome’s economic engine. Set in the flourishing provinces of southern Gaul or the fertile heartlands of Italy during the _Pax Romana_, your task is to weave prosperity from the land itself. Build farms, vineyards, and workshops to supply bustling towns and thriving trade routes. Connect estates and markets with roads, aqueducts, and harbors, ensuring that every amphora of wine and every sack of grain reaches its destination. In this world of peace, expansion is measured not in battles won, but in networks built and wealth sustained. The empire’s glory rests on your ability to expand and exploit its resources — to turn abundance into legacy.
