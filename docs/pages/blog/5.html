<h2>Devlog #5: Redesign the Main UI</h2><h3>🎯 Replacing the Popup Menu with a Side Panel + Action Bar</h3><img width="500" alt="UI Mockup of the main game screen showing a side panel listing the units and a bar of action buttons at the bottom of the screen" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/17e4ca4e-22cc-4524-9a4a-30db08ef55d3" style="float: right; max-width: 100%"><p>Hey everyone! I’m working on a major UI update for the game. Currently, unit actions are handled through a popup menu, but I’m aiming to replace that with a more intuitive and immersive layout:</p><ul><li>🧭 <b>Side Panel:</b> When a hex is selected, a panel will appear listing all units on that tile (e.g., 2 homesteaders and a rancher), and here the user can click one to activate it.</li><li>⚔️ <b>Bottom Action Bar:</b> A fixed bar will display context-sensitive buttons like Move, Attack, Build, Fortify, and Pass—streamlining gameplay and reducing clicks.</li></ul><p>This shift should improve clarity, reduce UI clutter, and make multi-unit management more fluid. I’ve mocked up the new layout and would love your thoughts on usability, layout, and any edge cases I should consider.</p><p>Feedback is appreciated on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/YodasWs/Samnite-Supply-Lines/discussions/54">GitHub</a>.</p><footer><a href="#!/blog/4/" rel="prev">Previous</a> | <a href="#!/blog/">Blog Home</a> | <a href="#!/blog/6/" rel="next">Next</a></footer>
