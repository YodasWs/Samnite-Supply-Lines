<h2>Devlog #1: Laying the Foundations</h2>
<p>
  While many games focus on the battlefields of Roman conquest, ours is about
  the true engine of the empire: the economy. In Empires-4x, you'll build the
  supply lines that turn a conquered province into a thriving part of the Roman
  world.
</p>
<p>
  Your goal is to tame this wild frontier: connect farms and ranches to markets,
  defend against traveling marauders, and build roads to supply Londinium and
  the Roman Empire.
</p>
<p>
  I'm currently building the core game loop, building the farms and collecting
  the food to feed your workers and ship the surplus to Londinium for profit.
  More challenges and depth of play is planned to follow.
