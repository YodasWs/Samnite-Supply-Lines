<h2>Devlog #2: Sowing the Seeds of Empire</h2>
<p>
  After weeks of tinkering, testing, and terrain-shaping, the core game loop of
  Empires-4x is alive and kicking! 🎉
</p>
<p>
  In this strategy-builder set on the wild frontier of Roman Britain, players
  take on the role of a provincial magnate, expanding their influence one
  hexagon at a time. And now, the foundational mechanics are officially in
  place:
</p>
<h3>🌾 Core Gameplay Loop Complete!</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Move your Worker across the rugged frontier to claim hexes and build Farms.
  </li>
  <li>Farms generate Food—the lifeblood of your budding empire.</li>
  <li>
    Food travels to the nearest Roman City, where it's converted into Points
    (and prestige).
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  This loop is the beating heart of the game: a rhythm of expansion, production,
  and reward that will soon be layered with challenges and cultural tensions
  between Roman settlers and native Britons.
</p>
<h3>Why This Matters</h3>
<p>
  Getting this loop right was crucial. It’s the scaffolding on which everything
  else will grow—economic systems, diplomacy, even invasions. And now that it’s
  solid, I can start weaving in the deeper strategy and storytelling that make
  this era so compelling.
</p>
<h3>What’s Next?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>🛠️ Introducing terrain bonuses and resource diversity</li>
  <li>🏘️ City upgrades and population dynamics</li>
  <li>🐎 Roman roads and maraurder attacks (yes, they’re coming…)</li>
</ul>
<p>
  If you love games like <i>Banished</i>, <i>Settlers</i>, or <i>Anno</i>, and
  you’ve ever wondered what it would feel like to tame the misty moors of
  Britannia with Roman efficiency—this one’s for you.
</p>
<p>
  Thanks for following along. The fields are ready to plow, the granaries need
  to be built, and the empire is on the rise.
</p>
<p>Stay tuned—and may your harvests be bountiful.</p>
