<h2>Devlog #3: A Growing Populace for Roman Britannia!</h2>
<p>Greetings, would-be governors of the untamed north!</p>
<p>
  Welcome back for another development update on our Roman Britain farming
  empire game. The legion is hard at work pushing back the frontiers, and we're
  excited to show you the fruits of our labor. Today, we're pulling back the
  curtain on some new art assets we've implemented for our units!
</p>
<h3>👥 Meet the workers of Britannia!</h3>
<p>
  Here is a closer look at the workers who will build your sprawling rural
  empire, from the humble Farmer to the daring Settler.

<h3>👨‍🌾 The Farmer</h3>
<p>
  Farmers are the lifeline of the frontier. Though this unit will build and then
  settle in a basic Subsistence Farm, toiling to grow just enough food to keep
  your growing population from going hungry, Farms can be upgraded to feed your
  entire workforce, and export a surplus to the Empire.
</p>
<h3>🐑 The Rancher</h3>
<p>
  More than just a herder, the Rancher is a pioneer of the wool trade. This unit
  will venture out to build a Sheep Ranch, where they will manage the sheep that
  provide the wool needed for both your local populace and for trade with the
  wider Roman world.
</p>
<h3>⛏️ The Miner</h3>
<p>
  The Miner's work is the foundation of your construction efforts. This unit
  will build and then operate a Mine, extracting the vital Stone and Metals
  needed to build and upgrade your buildings, fuel your industry, and allow for
  a higher level of prosperity.
</p>
<h3>🛖 The Settler</h3>
<p>
  These brave souls are the true pioneers of your empire. The Settler unit is
  essential for establishing new outposts and expanding your territory deeper
  into the wilderness of Roman Britain.
</p>
<h3>What's next?</h3>
<p>
  We're thrilled with how these new unit images are shaping up, and we hope you
  are, too! Seeing our workers brought to life like this makes the world feel
  more vibrant and alive.
</p>
<p><i>Cheers, and onward to prosperity!</i></p>
