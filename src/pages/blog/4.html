<h2>Devlog #4: Unit Movement Fix, and new UI Elements</h2>
<p>
  Hello, everyone! Another productive day has gone by, and I'm happy to report
  some significant quality-of-life improvements to the Empires-4x prototype.
</p>
<h3>🚶‍♂️ Unit Movement</h3>
<p>
  The most critical work today was fixing some pesky bugs related to unit
  movement from the action menu. I've spent the day tracking down and fixing
  that issue. You can now click or tap on a far-away hex and have your units
  move there over several turns!
</p>
<h3>🔎 Added Details in the Tile View</h3>
<p>
  While units were being wrangled, I also took some time to improve the UI. The
  tile view now displays the laborers assigned there and tells you the name of
  the terrain. This will give you a better understanding of the terrain and
  production at a glance. Information is king in a strategy game, and I'm
  continuing to work on presenting all the information you need.
</p>
<h3>What's Next?</h3>
<p>
  The game is becoming more playable by the day, but there's always more work to
  be done. There's still a lot of core UI enhancements and core game mechanics
  to add.
