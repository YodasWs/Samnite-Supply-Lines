<h2>🛠 Devlog #6: Behind the Scenes — Refactoring for the Future</h2>
<p>
  Hey everyone! 👋 This week’s update is less about flashy new features and more
  about the invisible scaffolding that makes everything else possible. I’ve been
  deep in the trenches refactoring the codebase — and while that might not sound
  glamorous, it’s a huge step toward long-term stability, scalability, and
  sanity.
</p>
<h3>📦 Modularization: Breaking the Monolith</h3>
<p>
  The first big shift is breaking the monolithic, interconnected block of code
  into smaller, ESModule-based architecture. This means each part of the game —
  from UI logic to game state to rendering — now lives in its own well-defined
  module. It’s already making the code easier to reason about, and it sets the
  stage for better tooling, bundling, and testing.
</p>
<h3>🧠 Functional Thinking</h3>
<p>
  I’m also been leaning into functional programming principles: pure functions,
  immutable, with clear data flow and no unintended side effects. This makes the
  code more reliable and predictable — which is especially important as the
  complexity of the game grows, reducing the mental load of adding new features.
</p>
<h3>✅ Unit Tests & Integration Tests</h3>
<p>
  To support all this, I’ll then be able to start building out a test suite.
  Unit tests cover the core logic (like tile adjacency, resource yields, and
  action costs), while integration tests simulate real gameplay flows. This
  gives me confidence that changes won’t break existing systems, new features
  won't introduce bugs in old features — and it’ll be a lifesaver as I continue
  evolving the UI and mechanics.
</p>
<h3>🔍 Why This Matters</h3>
<p>
  All of this is in service of a smoother, more maintainable game — one that’s
  easier to contribute to, easier to debug, and ultimately more fun to play.
  It’s the kind of work that doesn’t show up in screenshots, but it’s the
  foundation everything else rests on.
</p>
<p>
  Thanks for sticking with me through the quieter weeks. Big things are coming —
  and the code will be ready for them.
