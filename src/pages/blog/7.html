<h2>Devlog #7: Refactoring, Rebuilding, and Reclaiming Momentum</h2>
<p>
  The prototype is now almost fully back to the working state it was in before
  the refactor began. And it’s not just restored—it’s better. The systems are
  more robust, the codebase is more maintainable, and the groundwork is laid for
  future features like multiplayer, diplomacy, and dynamic overlays.
</p>
<p>
  I’ll be merging this work back into the public prototype soon, once I finish a
  few final touches and polish the dev experience. Thanks to everyone who’s been
  following along, and to those who’ve offered feedback and encouragement. This
  refactor was a leap, but it’s brought the project closer to the vision I’ve
  had all along.
</p>
<p>Stay tuned—Empires is about to get a lot more playable.</p>
