<h2>The Engine of Empire. The Roads to Londinium.</h2>
<h3>The empire is not built by legions, but by cart.</h3>

<p>
  In Empires 4x, you are not a legionary or an emperor, but the vital hand
  behind the Roman machine. Manage Britain's untamed wilds, building a network
  of farms and ranches to feed the growing demands of the bustling city of
  Londinium. Conquer the challenges of diverse terrains—from the fertile Fens to
  the windswept Moorlands—by laying down roads and canals to link your empire of
  production. Every cart of grain, every bale of wool, fuels the heart of Roman
  Britain. The legions may win the battles, but you will win the peace.
